    "our_story": "We met in 2006 while still at school at a Valentine’s disco and had our first date on Valentine’s day. We quickly became very close, experiencing all the important milestones you go through as you grow up. We got our GCSE and A level results together, passed our driving tests and experienced a long distant relationship whilst being at University. We got our first home 5 years ago and extended our family 2 years ago with our two beautiful cats Bea and Indy. We have always been obsessed with travelling together and have visited several countries. After 10 amazing years, Joe proposed at the top of Glacier Point in Yosemite National Park, California. To marry your first and only love, your best friend and the person that you have spent nearly half your life with is incredible. For us, love has been easy. We have been through so much already but know that together we can face it all. Our friends and family have been a very important part of our relationship, giving us so many happy memories together. Our wedding day isn’t just about the love we have for each other, but the love we have for all our guests too."
